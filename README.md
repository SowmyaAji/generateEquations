# generateEquations
A teaching / learning aid to generate simple linear algebra equations ands solve them 

## Overview
This project allows students of linear algebra to get an endless supply of two variable, three variable and linear inequality equations to work through, solve and gain practice as well as expertise. <br>
There is no limit to the number of times a student can try to answer the problems.<b>
The solutions are given if the student does not get answers. So, if the student wants to see the answers and the solutions, all the student needs to do is click on answers.<br> 
Additional links to Khan Academy tutorials, which I found extremely helpful while learning, have also been given below the solutions.<br>

### Usage
Three links are provided to individual pages that go to  the three variable, two variable or inequalities equation pages. Instructions on usage are there on the pages.<br>

#### Resources
This web app has been built entirely by me as a project for my MAT-121 class at Wake Tech. It is open for anyone to use with no restrictions.<br>
The app has been built entirely with vanilla JavaScript.<br>
Links to Khan Academy videos, with grateful thanks that is echoed across the globe by endless students to Sal Khan, have been included in this app.<br>
